## Attack on NDA (GSL)
It's disheartening, my friends, to witness the jewel of India, Manipur engulfed in flames. But what breaks my heart even more is the silence from the government on this critical issue. When a state is in shambles, lives are lost, and families are torn apart, one would expect our Prime Minister to take befitting action against these anti-social elements in Manipur. Sadly, no such actions have been taken, not even a soothing statement to comfort the victims. Ab Manipur ka har ek naagrik sarkar se poochna chahta hai, kahan gaye aapke acche din?

Our Prime Minister, seems to be a leader of the selected few - of Ambani and Adani. My mind is filled with a question that troubles me - where did those 20000 crore rupees in Mr. Adani's Shell Companies come from? Was it snatched from the pockets of taxpayers, or was forcefully extracted from other third-world nations? Pehle aap Adani Ji ke saath unke plane mein jaate the, ab wo aapke saath videshi dauron par jaate hain. 

When I seek answers to these type of uncomfortable questions by the NDA Government, I am disqualified from the Parliament. The media, once the fourth pillar of democracy, now appears to be dancing to the government's tune, leaving the opposition with a duty to expose the lies and conspiracies against the people of our nation. Be as nasty as you want, as evil as you want, I will remain as kind as I am, even to you. Main is nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan khol raha hun.  Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!
