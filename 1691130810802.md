## Attack on NDA (GSL)
It's disheartening, my friends, to witness the jewel of India, Manipur engulfed in flames. But what breaks my heart even more is the silence from the government on this critical issue. When a state is in shambles, lives are lost, and families are torn apart, one would expect our Prime Minister to take befitting action against these anti-social elements in Manipur. Sadly, no such actions have been taken, not even a soothing statement to comfort the victims. Ab Manipur ka har ek naagrik sarkar se poochna chahta hai, kahan gaye aapke acche din?

Our Prime Minister, seems to be a leader of the selected few - of Ambani and Adani. My mind is filled with a question that troubles me - where did those 20000 crore rupees in Mr. Adani's Shell Companies come from? Was it snatched from the pockets of taxpayers, or was forcefully extracted from other third-world nations? Pehle aap Adani Ji ke saath unke plane mein jaate the, ab wo aapke saath videshi dauron par jaate hain. 

When I seek answers to these type of uncomfortable questions by the NDA Government, I am disqualified from the Parliament. The media, once the fourth pillar of democracy, now appears to be dancing to the government's tune, leaving the opposition with a duty to expose the lies and conspiracies against the people of our nation. Be as nasty as you want, as evil as you want, I will remain as kind as I can, even to you. Main is nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan khol raha hun.  Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!

A Financial Times report claimed “offshore companies linked to the Adanis” invested at least $2.6 billion in the group between 2017 and 2022

## Moderated Caucus Topics
- Sedition Law  
The law of sedition was created by the British government as a tool to deal with any harsh criticism of the colonial administration and to employ it against the freedom fighters of this nation. Sometimes, I wonder that why this law is still a part of the Indian Constitution when it has been scrapped by the country which introduced the very law in this nation. We have witnessed a surge in the cases of sedition in recent years. So much so that the Supreme Court of India has questioned the law itself. In layman terms, Sedition is the illegal act of inciting people to resist or rebel against the government in power Several reports have revealed a rapid increase in sedition cases since the BJP came into power in 2014. Of the nearly 11,000 people charged in 816 sedition cases since 2010, 65% were charged after the Modi government came to power in 2014. These reports highlight how the BJP-ruled state governments have used sedition charges as a foolproof strategy whenever they faced public criticism or protests. During protests or events critical of the BJP government at the Centre and in the states, an increase in the sedition cases has been recorded. Out of around 190 accused of sedition in the year 2018, 2 were actually convicted. In 2019, the conviction rate for sedition cases was just 3.3%. Isn't it ironic? This law is brought into practice even when there is no danger to public order or incitement to violence. We, the INDIA alliance prospose the repealing of this colonial remnant, draconian law, which serves a puprose no more than jeopardising the liberty and rights of the citizens of this nation. 
- Anti-defection Law  
I would like to exclaim that there is a single party in India which has been creatively fabricating and utlising loopholes in a particular law - the anti-defection law, to their own advantage. In 2019, 17 MLAs from the JD(S)-Congress alliance shrewdly resigned from the assembly, instead of their political party to defect to BJP to avail the perks of office offered by them in the event of the latter forming the government, thus, preventing the charge of the anti-defection law upon them. As predicted, the BJP formed their government in K'taka a few days later. Similarly, in the year 2002, a senior leader of the Shiv Sena, a former autowallah, Mr. Eknath Shinde poached 55 MLA's from the Sena to BJP and in a time span of mere ten days, took an oath as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Soon, a collaboration was struck between the chaiwallah and the autowallah to administer the state with the hiest GDP. The 10th schedule has become a defectors' paradise. After 2014, 8 governments were overturned. The actions of these power-hungry ministers of this nation has made a sheer mockery out of the law of this country. Lekin hum hamare raksha mantri ki tarah sirf iski 'kadi ninda' karne ki bajaye, kuch sujhaav bhi dena chahenge, taki iss desh ke kanoon kaagaz par hi nahi, par asal zindagi mein bhi deshwasiyon ko nyaay dilwa payein. We would like to propose an amendment to the anti-defection law suggesting a ban on the public office the defectors for ten years and fighting the next election. This is the sole vaccine for this virus of blind corruption of power. Dalbadluon ki ek sarkaar, modi sarkaar, modi sarkaar!
