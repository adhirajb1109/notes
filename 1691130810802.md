## Attacks on NDA
Manipur is burning! You all are seeing what's happening in Manipur. You would have thought when a state is in shambles, hundreds are being killed every single day, the Prime Minister would take action. Let alone taking action on the hear-wrenching riots in Manipur, our beloved PM has not even given a statement about it. It's because Modi is only the PM of the selected few, of the RSS. He very clearly knows in his heart, that it is his ideology which has set Manipur ablaze. For power, they will burn Manipur, they will set the entire country ablaze. They don't care about the sorrow and pain of the common man of the country.
