## Attack on NDA (GSL)
It's disheartening, my friends, to witness the jewel of India, Manipur engulfed in flames. But what breaks my heart even more is the silence from the government on this critical issue. When a state is in shambles, lives are lost, and families are torn apart, one would expect our Prime Minister to take befitting action against these anti-social elements in Manipur. Sadly, no such actions have been taken, not even a soothing statement to comfort the victims. Ab Manipur ka har ek naagrik sarkar se poochna chahta hai, kahan gaye aapke acche din?

Our Prime Minister, seems to be a leader of the selected few - of Ambani and Adani. My mind is filled with a question that troubles me - where did those 20000 crore rupees in Mr. Adani's Shell Companies come from? Was it snatched from the pockets of taxpayers, or was forcefully extracted from other third-world nations? Pehle aap Adani Ji ke saath unke plane mein jaate the, ab wo aapke saath videshi dauron par jaate hain. 

When I seek answers to these type of uncomfortable questions by the NDA Government, I am disqualified from the Parliament. The media, once the fourth pillar of democracy, now appears to be dancing to the government's tune, leaving the opposition with a duty to expose the lies and conspiracies against the people of our nation. Be as nasty as you want, as evil as you want, I will remain as kind as I am, even to you. Main is nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan khol raha hun.  Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!

## Moderated Caucus Topics
- Sedition Law  
The law of sedition was created by the British government as a tool to deal with any harsh criticism of the colonial administration and to employ it against the freedom fighters of the Indian national movement. We have witnessed a surge in the cases of sedition in recent years. So much so that the Supreme Court of India has questioned the law itself. In layman terms, Sedition is the illegal act of inciting people to resist or rebel against the government in power Several reports have revealed a rapid increase in sedition cases since the BJP came into power in 2014. These reports highlight how the BJP-ruled state governments have used sedition charges as a foolproof strategy whenever they faced public criticism or protests. During protests or events critical of the BJP government at the Centre and in the states, an increase in the sedition cases has been recorded. Ironically, in 2019, the conviction rate for sedition cases was just 3.3%. Human rights activists have demanded the repeal of Section 124A, asserting that a draconian colonial provision should have no place in this democratic country. This law is brought into practice even when there is no danger to public order or incitement to violence. This law is being used as a tool for harassment of citizens for trivial reasons. We, the INDIA alliance prospose the repealing of this colonial remnant, draconian law, which serves a puprose no more than jeopardising the liberty and rights of the citizens of this nation.
