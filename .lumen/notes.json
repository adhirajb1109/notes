But what breaks my heart even more is the silence from the government on this critical issue. When a state is in shambles, lives are lost, and families are torn apart, one would expect our Prime Minister to take befitting action against these anti-social elements in Manipur. Sadly, no such actions have been taken, not even a soothing statement to comfort the victims. Manipur ka har ek naagrik ab sarkar se puch raha hai, kahan gaye aapke acche din?\n\nOur Prime Minister, seems to be a leader of the selected few - of Ambani and Adani. My mind is filled with a question that troubles me - where did those 20000 crore rupees in Mr. Adani's Shell Companies come from? Was it snatched from the pockets of taxpayers, or was forcefully extracted from other third-world nations? Pehle aap Adani Ji ke saath unke plane mein jaate the, ab wo aapke saath videshi dauron par jaate hain. \n\nWhen I seek answers to these type of uncomfortable questions by the NDA Government, I am disqualified from the Parliament. The media, once the fourth pillar of democracy, now appears to be dancing to the government's tune, leaving the opposition with a duty to expose the lies and conspiracies against the people of our nation. Be as nasty as you want, as evil as you want, I will remain as kind as I am, even to you. Main is nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan khol raha hun.  Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!\n"}
