But what breaks my heart even more is the inaction, the silence from the NDA Government in this critical moment. When a state is in shambles, lives are lost, and families are torn apart, one would expect our Prime Minister to take resolute action against these anti-social elements in Manipur. Sadly, no such actions have been taken, not even a soothing word to comfort the victims. Kahan gaye aapke acche din?\n\nModi Ji, our Prime Minister, seems to be a leader of the selected few - of the RSS and of Mr. Adani. They seem to care more about power than the lives of their fellow citizens who toil day and night, shedding blood, sweat, and tears for their hard-earned money. My mind is filled with a question that haunts me - where did those staggering 20000 crore rupees in Mr. Adani's Shell Companies come from? Did it flow from Modi Ji's hands, from the pockets of taxpayers, or forcefully extracted from the other third-world nations. Pehle aap Adani Ji ke plane mein jaate the, ab wo aapke saath aapke videshi dauron par jaate hain.\n\nAs I seek answers to these crucial questions for the common man by the NDA Government, I am disqualified from the Parliament. The media, once the fourth pillar of democracy, now appears to be dancing to the government's tune, leaving the opposition with a duty to expose the lies and conspiracies against the people of our nation. Be as nasty as you want, as evil as you want, I will remain as kind as I am, even to you. Main is nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan khol raha hun.  Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!\n"}
